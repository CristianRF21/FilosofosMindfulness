//Filosofos Minfullness App

<p>Welcome to my Filosofos Mindfulness App, a platform that I created where users can come to decompress and meditate. This user-friendly app offers inspirational quotes, a meditation timer where users can take time for themselves, and some support for those seeking extra help. This app was created with the intent of leaving users a little better than when they first came to the app.</p>

//Begin
<p>Filosofos Mindfullness is an IOS App that was created using Xcode and Swift UI. To view the app and test it you need the Xcode software to implement it and test it.</p>


// Table of contents
<p>The app is divided into two main parts. The first page when the app is opened is the title and a symbol in hebrew called the chai that means to be alive. In the first page you'll also find a button at the bottom of the page. When the button is clicked it will take you to the homepage/bio of the app. In the home section of the app there is some information about the app such as what it's about and what the hope is for the user's through this platform. I created this app to help users who are struggling with mental health so that in this platform the may find some help.</p>
<li>Home</li>
 <li>Daily Quotes</li>
<li>Timer</li>
<li>Support</li>

//Tabs
<p>The app is composed of four tabs the home, daily quotes, meditation timer, and support tab. In the home tab is found brief information on the app and what the user will find along with the use of the app. The second tab is the daily quotes tab and when its clicked by the user they'll find a quote on display with a button below it to show another quote. Everytime that the user click's the button the app will display another quote from the list in a random order. The third tab is the timer tab, when clicked it'll distplay a meditation timer with a start button below it. When start is clicked the time will start and when the user is ready to stop meditating they simply click the stop button again. When the stop button is clicked the time will immediately reset back to 0. The fourth and final tab is the support tab. When the tab is clicked it will display a page about support information where the user can contact a hotline for support if needed. If the user would like to return to the main title page it is possible to do so from any tab by simply clicking the back button found at the top left of the app.</p>
