//Filosofos Minfulness App

<p>Welcome to my Filosofos Mindfulness App, a platform that I created where users can come to decompress and meditate. This user-friendly app offers inspirational quotes, a meditation timer where users can take time for themselves, and some support for those seeking extra help. This app was created with the intent of leaving users a little better than when they first came to the app.</p>

//App Design
<p>The app design for my Filosofos Mindfulness Appis I wanted it to be simple so that it could be user-friendly and easy to use. For the design and aesthetic, I wanted simple color and simple fonts easy for the user to interpret and follow. The app itself begins with a title page and button that directs you the inside of the app. It is divided into the tree main parts the "ContentView", "MainPage", and all of te "TabView".</p>
